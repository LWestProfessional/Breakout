A version of Breakout that I created by folowing the Tutorial provided to me. The bar is controlled by the mouse and the player has three lives. If the ball touches the bottom of the screen you will lose a life and once all lives are expended the game will reset. The ball can destroy the blocks in the upper half of the screen and if you can keep it bouncing long enough to destroy every block you will win and recieve a congratulatory message. After the message has been closed the game will reset.
